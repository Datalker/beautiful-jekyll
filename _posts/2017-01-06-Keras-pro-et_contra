Here I will describe what do I like and what not about Keras framework. Before going further need to mention tw obvious disclaimers: 
- It may easily happen that I've missed some features or they appeared after time of this post, if so please let me know will do my best to fix
- Of course this post (as any of it's kind) is opinionated, so take it  easy :)

What I do like about Keras
1. It's very easy to start with ANN

What I don't like about Keras
1. Documentation is detailed, however still description of some parts (especially parameters) is ambigious. Maybe it's because of overall NN topic complexity
