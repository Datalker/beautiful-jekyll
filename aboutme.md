### Short intro
My name is Evgeny Arnautov (aka Datalker). I have a pretty diverse IT 10 years experience from Perl/PHP scripting to project management and IT Strategy consulting. Now I'm workign a Data scientist. And my main passion with Machine Learning with focus on Deep learning and AI.

### About this blog
This blog has several goals:

- Structure and capture insights along the learning way (I believe it has no end :))
- I'm receiving much support from community, it's time to become useful as well
- Get new input/comments/points of view from reader. It's always valuable

### Tech stack I mainly use

- Python3 as core
- Data exploration: SciPy (Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter)
- Machine learning (not NN): scikit-learn
- Neural nets: Keras over Tensorflow
- Visualization: Bokeh and Matplotlib
- Web scraping: Scrapy + ScrapingHub
