### Short intro
My name is Evgeny Arnautov (aka Datalker). I have 10 years of a diverse IT experience spreading from Perl/PHP scripting to project management and IT Strategy consulting. Now I'm working as a Data scientist and doing Web scraping in spare time as freelancer. Main area of interest and growth for now is Machine Learning with focus on Deep learning and AI.

### About this blog
This blog has several goals:

- Structure and capture insights along the learning way
- I'm receiving much support from community, so probably it's time to pay back
- Get new inputs/comments/points of view from readers. they are always valuable

### Tech stack I mainly use

- Python
- Data exploration: SciPy (Pandas, Numpy, Jupyter)
- Machine learning (not NN): scikit-learn
- Neural nets: Keras over Tensorflow
- Visualization: Bokeh and Matplotlib
- Web scraping: Scrapy + ScrapingHub
